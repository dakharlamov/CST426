Service Locator Pattern

The Project folder contains all the source code for my implementation of the Service Locator design pattern.
The tests folder contains the source code for the tests which contains the main entry point for the 
program that creates the instances of the objects and test them.


Tests call upon a child of GUI using a service locator to handle some methods.

Just run the project to see the output of the tests.
