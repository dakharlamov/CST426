Subclass Sandbox Pattern

The Project folder contains all the source code for my implementation of the Subclass Sandbox design pattern.
The tests folder contains the source code for the tests which contains the main entry point for the 
program that creates the instances of the objects and test them.


The Test creates one instance of each spell and adds it to a list.
All spells are then called displaying engine useage.

Just run the project to see the output of the tests.
