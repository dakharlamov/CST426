Update Method Pattern


The update pattern folder contains all the source code for my implementation of the update design pattern.
The tests folder contains the source code for the tests which contains the main entry point for the 
program that creates the instances of the objects and test them.


The test is a simulation of a game that takes 20 frames to complete. The test displays the state
of all entities at each frame.

Just run the project to see the output of the tests.
