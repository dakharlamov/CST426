Object Pool Design Pattern


The Project folder contains all the source code for my implementation of the Object Pool design pattern.
The tests folder contains the source code for the tests which contains the main entry point for the 
program that creates the instances of the objects and test them.


The tests generate a vertex pool and tests filling and removing items from the object pool.

Just run the project to see the output of the tests.
